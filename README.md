# ProxyCannon-NG

>Thank you **Wild West Hackin' Fest** for your help and support in our community-driven hackathon!  We've created a on-demand proxy tool that leverages cloud environments giving a user the ability to source (all) your traffic from an endless supply of  cloud based IP address. Think of it as your own private TOR network for your redteam and pentest engagements. No more defenses throttling and blocking you!

Hackathon sponsored by [Sprocket Security](https://www.sprocketsecurity.com) and hosted at [Wild West Hackin' Fest 2018](https://www.wildwesthackinfest.com)

### Hackathon Results
In two days, we built the initial release of proxycannon-ng. We're in the process of ironing out final changes and will continue to improve the tool.

**Objectives:**
  
~~VPN Server Build (scripted)~~  
~~Client VPN (Full Tunnel)~~  
~~Terraform Node Management (Build, Destroy, Routing)~~  
~~AWS Multipath Node Routing (Load Balanced Exit Nodes)~~  
Node VPN Tunnels  
Support multiple cloud environments (initial release only supports AWS)

## Setup
The control-server is a OpenVPN server that your workstation will connect to. This server always remains up. Exit-nodes are systems connected to the control-server that provides load balancing and multiple source IP addresses. Exit-nodes can scale up and down to suite your needs.

### AWS (setup the control-server)
#### 1. Create a separate SSH key pair
1. In the AWS console, go to **services** (upper left)
2. Select **EC2** under the Compute section.
3. Select **Key Pairs** in the nav on the left.
4. Select **Create Key Pair** and name it 'proxycannon'.
5. Download and save the key to **~/.ssh/proxycannon.pem**

#### 2. Launch the control-server instance
1. Launch (1) Ubuntu Server t1-micro instance, recommend public AMI ami-0f65671a86f061fcd, and use the "proxycannon" keypair.
2. Login to the control-server and download proxycannon-ng:  
```git clone https://github.com/proxycannon/proxycannon-ng```
3. cd into proxycannon-ng/setup and run `sudo ./install.sh`

#### 3. Create a new IAM user, set the needed permissions, and copy over your keys. It's quick:
1. In the AWS console, go to **services** (upper left)
2. Select **IAM** under the Security, Identity & Compliance section
3. In IAM, select **Users** in the nav on the left.
4. Select **Add user**
5. Fill out a User name, and for access type, select programmatic access. Click **Next**.
6. Select the tab/box that's labeled **Attach existing policies directly**. Add the following policy: AmazonEC2FullAccess. Click **Next**, than **Create user**
7. Copy the access key and secret for the control-server and paste it in ~/.aws/credentials ex:
```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_OWN
aws_secret_access_key = REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_OWN
region = us-east-2
```

#### 4. Setup terraform
Perform the following on the control-server:
1. Copy your proxycannon.pem SSH key into `~/.ssh/proxycannon.pem`
2. cd into `proxycannon-ng/nodes/aws` and edit the `variables.tf` file updating it with the **subnet_id**. This is the same subnet_id that your control server is using. You can get this value from the AWS console when viewing the details of the control-server instance. Defining this subnet_id makes sure all launched exit-nodes are in the same subnet as your control server.
2. Run `terraform init` to download the AWS modules. (you only need to do this once)

#### 5. Copy OpenVPN files to your workstation
Copy the contents of the ~/proxycannon-vpn-client folder on your workstation:
```
scp -i proxycannon.pem ubuntu@<external_ip>:/home/ubuntu/proxycannon-vpn-client/* .
```

Test OpenVPN connectivity from your workstation by running:
```
openvpn --config proxycannon-client.conf
```

**Setup Completed! yay!** From now on you'll only need to connect to the VPN to use proxycannon-ng. The next section details how to add and remove exit-nodes (source IPs):

## Managing exit-nodes
Scaling of exit-nodes is controlled on the control-server using terraform.
### Scale up exit-nodes
To create AWS exit-nodes, do the following:
1. cd into `proxycannon-ng/nodes/aws`
2. Edit the count value in `variables.tf` to the number of exit-nodes (source IPs) you'd like
3. run `terraform apply` to launch the instances.

### Scale down exit-nodes
If you want to stop all exit-nodes run `terraform destroy`.  
OR  
Scaling down exit-nodes can be done by reducing the count value in `variables.tf` and running `terraform apply` again. Terraform will automatically remove X number of exit-node instances.
